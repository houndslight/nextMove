# nextMove | No ads. No trackers. Just your applications.

A simple, open-source job application tracker built in **Rust** with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).  
Keep your career organized without handing your data to a third party.

---

## Features
- Add and manage job applications (company, position, status).
- Track interview dates (with calendar-style sorting).
- Update statuses as your application progresses.
- Data persistence via `job_data.json` (local-first, no servers needed).
- Clean, distraction-free interface powered by egui.
- 100% FOSS. Zero ads. Zero telemetry.
